# Overview
The Intelligent Mechanical Design Assistant is a Streamlit application that leverages advanced language models to assist users in querying and analyzing research papers in mechanical engineering. The application utilizes Groq and Hugging Face embeddings to create a vector database, enabling efficient document retrieval and context-based question answering. Additionally, it evaluates the model's responses using the BLEU score and provides various visualizations to analyze performance metrics.

# Features
**Document Ingestion:** Load and process PDF documents from a specified directory.
**Contextual Querying:** Users can input questions, and the model provides answers based on the loaded documents.
**Performance Metrics:** The application calculates and visualizes BLEU scores, precision, recall, and F1 scores for the generated answers.
**Visual Analytics:** Several plots display trends and distributions of performance metrics over multiple queries.

# Technologies Used
**Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
**LangChain:** To facilitate the creation of language model chains and document loaders.
**FAISS:** For efficient similarity search and clustering of embeddings.
**Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization.
**OpenAI API:** For integrating with the language model.
**Python:** Programming language for developing the application.
